# Technical Challenge

## Background

Suppose we are a fast-growing restaurant management platform, as a developer, you are required to design a
solution to our product listing system in order to display all the products available to our waiters, and let them
create an order with many products. Letâ€™s imagine we have many restaurants as clients and each has multiple
products ready to sell.


**For example:** SuperSano restaurant has Kuva Roast Rib-Eye ($418), Guadalupe Half Rack ($298), and
Tohono Chicken ($308).

## Requirements

Create a Node.JS based API which exposes the necessary endpoints.

Create a simple UX in React for a restaurant.
- You can use any framework on the backend.
- Use React on the frontend.
- Use TypeScript.
- The UI/UX should be intuitive and easy to use.
- Display an infinite scroll of the places and the products.
- Write tests where you think appropriate.

## Bonus Points
- Deploy and host it in the cloud so we can access it via a public URL.
- Implement your own infinite scroll component.

    I have not enough  experience with TypeORM but for some reason is turning decimals into strings,
    in the Database i can see it's stored as a numeric. I found this the following solution:

/// ColumnNumericTransformer
export class ColumnNumericTransformer {
    to(data: number): number {
      return data;
    }
    from(data: string): number {
      return parseFloat(data);
    }
  }
